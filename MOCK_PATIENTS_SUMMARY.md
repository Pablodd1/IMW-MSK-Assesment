- **16 weeks:** 30-45% improvement from baseline
- **6-12 months:** 60-100% improvement in many areas

### **FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES**

**8 Weeks:**
- ✅ Walk to community center independently with cane
- ✅ Climb stairs with handrail using step-over-step pattern (ascent)
- ✅ Stand from chair without using armrests (most of the time)
- ✅ Perform ADLs with increased confidence and safety
- ✅ Reduced fear of falling
- ✅ **Maintained independent living status**

**16 Weeks:**
- ✅ Walk outdoors confidently with cane on level surfaces
- ✅ Navigate community with minimal assistance
- ✅ Climb/descend stairs safely with handrail (step-over-step both directions)
- ✅ Participate in senior center activities without fear
- ✅ Reduced medication usage for pain (fewer NSAIDs)
- ✅ Improved sleep quality (less pain)

**6-12 Months:**
- ✅ Safe community ambulation (cross streets safely)
- ✅ Maintain zero falls with continued exercise
- ✅ Able to play with grandchildren on floor
- ✅ Travel to visit daughter (Portland) with confidence
- ✅ Consider discontinuing cane for indoor use (with physician approval)

### **ADDITIONAL CRITICAL INTERVENTIONS**

**1. HOME SAFETY MODIFICATIONS (URGENT)**
- ❌ REMOVE all area rugs or secure with double-sided tape
- ✅ Install nightlights in bathroom and hallways
- ✅ Install raised toilet seat (+4 inches)
- ✅ Add grab bars near toilet, in shower, beside bed, in hallway
- ✅ Increase lighting throughout apartment
- ✅ Motion-sensor nightlights for nighttime bathroom trips
- ✅ Remove clutter from walkways, secure electrical cords

**2. ASSISTIVE DEVICE RECOMMENDATIONS**
- Continue cane use (especially outdoors and stairs)
- Ensure proper cane height (wrist level, elbow ~30° flexion)
- Consider quad cane for outdoor use (increased stability)
- **DO NOT recommend walker yet** (patient resistance) - revisit if no progress in 8 weeks

**3. MEDICATION REVIEW**
- Refer to PCP for review of 11 medications
- Several medications have fall-risk potential (gabapentin, meloxicam, lisinopril)
- Consider timing adjustments or alternatives

**4. VISION & HEARING CHECKS**
- Ophthalmologist eye exam (last cataract surgery 2018)
- Check glasses prescription (bifocal adjustment for fall prevention)
- Hearing test (impaired hearing affects balance)

**5. FOOTWEAR ASSESSMENT**
- Proper athletic shoes with:
  - Good arch support, non-slip soles, secure closure (not slip-on), low heel
- AVOID: Backless slippers, high heels, worn-out soles, loose shoes

**6. FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION**
- Recognize fall risk factors
- Safe movement strategies (sit at edge of bed before standing)
- What to do if you fall (floor-to-stand practice)
- Importance of reporting falls/near-falls
- When to use assistive device

**7. SOCIAL SUPPORT & MONITORING**
- Daily check-in with son or daughter
- Encourage senior center activities (tai chi, seated yoga)
- Emergency response plan with neighbors
- Family awareness of fall risk and prevention

**Prognosis:** **Fair to Good** with consistent participation - Multiple barriers but motivated patient with strong support system
